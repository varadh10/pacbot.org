<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-cloud-security-is-everyones-business">Gartner
predicts</a>
that “through 2020, 95 percent of cloud security failures will be the
customer’s fault.”   <br>
The very nature of public cloud, the ease at which developers can
create, modify and delete resources –gives us the agility we love but
also makes it easy to overlook security guidelines. The dynamic nature
of the cloud further complicates matters, especially if you have a very
large footprint.</p>
<p>From a recent
<a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2018-cloud-security-report-download/">survey</a>
conducted by cybersecurity-insiders.com,
these are the most significant cloud security threats:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Misconfiguration of the cloud platform/wrong set-up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unauthorized access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insecure interfaces/APIs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hijacking of accounts, services or traffic</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At 62 percent, misconfiguration jumped to the number one spot this year
as the single biggest threat to cloud security. Misconfiguration becomes
increasingly likely as we migrate more workloads to the cloud. Properly
configuring cloud resources requires a new set of skills and an
understanding of how cloud resources are managed. Traditional security
tools are not enough because they are focused on the operating system
and application level. A new set of tools are required to mitigate the
risks associated with the ‘shared responsibility’ security model of
public cloud.</p>
<p>Doing audits and compliance checks a few times a year doesn’t cut it.
What is needed is an automated compliance framework that allows us to
ensure that security and compliance requirements are being met in real
time.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-pacbot-continuous-compliance-with-policy-as-code">Introducing PacBot: Continuous compliance with policy-as-code</h2>
<p>PacBot is a platform for continuous security and compliance assessment,
reporting and automation. It assesses our infrastructure against
security best practices and T-Mobile internal security and governance
policies. We use it to ensure adherence across all of our AWS accounts.
PacBot also has ‘auto fixes’ to automatically respond to critical
security policy violations.</p>
<p>Policy violations identified by PacBot are presented to asset owners via
simple dashboards. These dashboards that make it easy to remediate the
issues found. With PacBot we have eliminated the manual drudgery of
compliance assessment letting us invest more time mitigating risks and
addressing the gaps found.</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/pacbot-compliance.png" alt="pacbot-compliance"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of PacBot - Compliance Landing Page</em></p>
<p>After initial success with cloud misconfigurations, we branched out into
policies to assess SSL certificate expiration, host patch level,
vulnerabilities and inventory. PacBot has become the central place to
view overall compliance adherence status and has evolved into a generic
tool where we can codify any policy and do continuous compliance
monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-bit-of-history-">A Little bit of history …</h2>
<p>Late in 2016, when we were looking to solve the automated assessment and
cloud misconfiguration problem we had few options. The first version of
PacBot was built using AWS Config rules and lambda functions. The
limitations around config rules (at that time), combined with the
complexity of managing multiple accounts and a never-ending need for
customized reports scoped at different levels made us revisit the
design.</p>
<p>At that time, a few SaaS players started providing this type of
solution. After some test drives, we felt deep integration with existing
systems for non-cloud related compliance would be a challenge. We didn’t
want to use multiple tools and dashboards and we were not comfortable
giving out all of our AWS data either. So we decided to give it a go
ourselves and ended up building PacBot as it is now. It was initially
named as Policy as Code Manager (PacMan). When we decided to go open
source we changed it to avoid confusion with the video game. PacBot is
still cute though :).</p>
<h2 id="how-does-pacbot-work">How does PacBot work?</h2>
<p>Assess -&gt; Report -&gt; Remediate -&gt; Repeat is PacBot’s philosophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A policy is described as code and human readable metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connectors discover resources at a set cadence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codified policies assess compliance adherence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy violation is logged to violation tracker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation may be remediated automatically or through 1-click automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violations are automatically closed in the next assessment when the problem is fixed at the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exception Manager is used for granting exceptions to violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sticky Exceptions are exceptions based on a resource matching criteria rather than specific resource IDs (for assets that will be created in future).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a high level roll-up of the capabilities. In next blog post, I
will detail out the architecture, different components of the solution
and how it works.</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/capabilities.png" alt="pacbot-capabilities"></p>
<p>Below is a simplified system architecture of PacBot.
<img src="./index_files/architecture.png" alt="pacbot-architecture"></p>
<h2 id="automatic-fixes-for-misconfigurations">Automatic fixes for misconfigurations…</h2>
<p>Our AutoFix journey started with closing publicly accessible S3 buckets.
With every codified policy, you can implement an AutoFix hook. Today
when any of our developers open an S3 bucket for public read or write,
PacBot finds it and sends out a notification to the user about the
policy violation and gives 24 hours to fix it. After 24 hours, if an
exception is not granted, PacBot revokes the public access
automatically.</p>
<p>In a cloud environment, there is continuous deployment and activity. The
rate of change is so high that with just monitoring you end up with
massive to-do lists. By the time you get around to fixing problems, the
information might be out of date. AutoFixes are the best option to
reduce the mean time to respond/repair a policy violation.</p>
<p>PacBot also uses data from other systems we’ve built over the course of
PacBot’s development history:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blackbox: a central, searchable store of enriched CloudTrail events from all of our AWS accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Periscope: a tool for access permissions lookup and reverse lookup for users across all of our AWS accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heimdall: a central repository with critical alerts from security solutions like AWS Guard Duty, Macie, Trend Micro Deep Security, Tripwire and access logs from critical core infrastructure supporting workloads deployed on AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delta: a tool to audit what changes have occurred in our AWS environment in a given time range.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have plans to open source these as well.</p>
<p>When we decided to open source PacBot, we wanted it to be a simple
process to try it out. Our PacBot installer is still in its infancy, but
you should be able to get everything up and running with a little help
from a cup of coffee.</p>
